## SQL Analysis
The analysis is divided into five sections:

1. **Basic Sales Insights** â€“ Transaction counts, total revenue, customer count, and country-level purchases.  
2. **Product & Stock Analysis** â€“ Top-selling products, highest revenue items, low-frequency sales, and average prices.  
3. **Customer Analysis** â€“ Top customers by spend, purchase diversity, and loyalty.  
4. **Time-Based Analysis** â€“ Monthly trends, busiest times, and weekday/weekend performance.  
5. **Advanced Insights** â€“ Most popular product per country, month-over-month growth, and returns impact.
